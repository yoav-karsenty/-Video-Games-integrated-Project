# Video Games integrated Project
In this project, containing data about the online store Ice, which sells video games all over the world. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available from open sources.

My goal is to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This will allow me to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns.

I will handle the data with the next steps: 
1. Exploring the data for first impression on it. 
2. Prepare the data( Fixing data types,treat missing values, adding nescesary columns)
3. Analyse the data
4. Test hypotheses 
6. Reacing conclusions.

# Skills demonstrated :

3. visualisations tools with matplotlib and seaborn
